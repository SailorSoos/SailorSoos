- 👋 Hi, I'm raised as Canadian, but live in New Zealand. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all sports analytics - datascraping, data visualisation, and technical analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m weirdly interested in data structures & analysis! Not so much hardware, but can work my head around it. 
- 📫 You can reach me at peter.soosalu@gmail.com.
